To help the marketing team, we can identify the top 3 most profitable products by analyzing total sales and quantity sold.
The most popular products will likely be those that combine quality and convenience, such as premium snacks. 
Loyal customers tend to be in the Premium segment, purchasing higher-end items, and are often Young Singles/Couples who have more disposable income. 
By segmenting customers based on their LIFESTAGE and PREMIUM_CUSTOMER status, we can tailor marketing efforts to highlight premium products to affluent
groups and budget-friendly options to more price-sensitive segments. Machine learning can further classify customers into categories, predicting buying behaviors and 
optimizing targeting strategies. This approach will enable the department to focus on the most profitable customers and products, positioning them better in the market.
